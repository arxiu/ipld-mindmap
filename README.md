# IPLD Mindmap

## Context
We're in a personal contest to understand and try to change how do we organize our own information, and how it relates to others. The full explanation of why and how is something we're working on.

Since the scope of the project is inmense, we're going to tackle small projects to get insight, while creating new tools to allow new ways to relate to information.

This is the first "project" we try to tackle. While creating a tool is the main goal, is likley that we will also be exploring  working frameworks and different documentation praxis.

Documentation is important to us, because we are looking to solve problems in the best way possible, so if the logic behind is not good enough, we want to know. And probably you can help!

:)

## Mindmap
We like the idea of mindmap, a tool that allows to organize information in the way that your brain works and not in a simplified way restricted by a user interface or a data structure.

[The wikpedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) says that mindmaps are hierachical and around a single concept. Our aproach is more generic. We want a tool to organize our brain, and this implies non hierachical structures.

## Original specs

- [ ] Create a tool that would allow to represent what you could do in a analog mindmap, but in a digital format.
- [ ] The main goal is to design and justifiy the correct data structure.
    - [ ] It needs to work on a global domain. This means that two different mindmaps pointing to the same concept should converge if put together
    - [ ] It extends [IPLD](https://ipld.io/)
    - [ ] As simple as possible
    - [ ] As generic as possible (can cover as many usecases as possible)
    - [ ] Any type of data should be able to be referenced
- [ ] Eventually we'll explore authorship, accessibility, networking... but not yet.
- [ ] It should have some basic visualization
- [ ] The tool is render agnostic. Diferent renders can be eventually used.
- [ ] We should document the process and the reasoning behind as close as possible
- [ ] It should work on the web. Because of ease of use and development.
- [ ] MVP approach. Keep things lean.
- [ ] Nice to have
    - [ ] Load content and render via IPFS
    - [ ] Compatible with any IPFS/IPLD object

Deadline: end of September 2018

## Data structure

### Nodes in the global domain
For _Global domain_ we understand that there is only one single giant mindmap.

Which means that we need to be able to break in down into smaller subsets/pieces. The atomic piece of a mindmap is a node.

A node is nothing but a set of `relations` around a concept/content/idea. We call this "concept" `origin`.
So the `origin` is the data that represents where the `relations` are coming form.

These relations are towards another piece of data. From the `node` perspective, we call these data `targets`

**This implies that each `node` needs to contain and describe the `relations` with all the other `targets` it is interested, because if broken apart, it will loose information it cares about.**

In other words, `relations` come out of the `origin`, **never** in (at least from the `origin` perspective). If that was the case we will have a duplicated source of truth (the `relation` from the incoming `origin` and the `relation` from the current `origin`). This does not mean that the relation can't represent an incoming direction.

It makes a node behave selfishly, which is the logical behaviour in a distributed system.

Since we're in a global domain we will need to represent a subset of the global mindmap.

A subset representation of the mindmap will then be just a lists of nodes

_In the following examples nodes will be shown as part of an array, but it likley makes more sense to be handled independently (The array should not be part of the IPLD object?)_

```json
[
    {
        "origin":"Node1",
    },
    {
        "origin":"Node2"
    },
]
```

### Relationships and nodes
We understand `relation` as how a piece of data relates (`origin`) to another peice of data (`target`)

A node can have an arbitrary number of `relations`. For ease of use, and to save some memory this seems the logical representation:

```json
[
    {
        "origin":"Node1",
        "relations": ["relation1", "relation2"]
    },
    {
        "origin":"Node2",
        "relations": []
    },
]
```

But because we're on a global domain, the same node may have different relations in a different subset of the mindmap. This implies that it can also be represented like this:

```json
[
    {
        "origin":"Node1",
        "relations": ["relation1"]
    },
    {
        "origin":"Node1",
        "relations": ["relation2"]
    },
    {
        "origin":"Node2",
        "relations": []
    },
]
```

### Relationship definition
To define a relation we need two nodes and a definition of the `type` of relation they have between them.

The `type` is not mandatory. 

Because the selfish behaviour of a node described above, a reltionship is always described from the perspective of the `origin` towards the `target`

```json
[
    {
        "origin":"Son",
        "relations": [
            {
                "target": "Dad",
                "type": "Is my dad"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "origin":"Dad",
        "relations": [
            {
                "target": "Son",
                "type": "Is my son"
            }
        ]
    }
]
```
The selfhish behaviour implies that there is no way to guarantee the integrity of the information, since the nodes could express conflicting information. And that's ok because **each node have it's own truth**.

```json
[
    {
        "origin":"Son",
        "relations": [
            {
                "target": "Dad",
                "type": "Is NOT my dad"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "origin":"Dad",
        "relations": [
            {
                "target": "Son",
                "type": "Is my son"
            }
        ]
    },
]
```

### Merkle paths as identifiers
In the previous examples we've used sample text in the `origin` field, to uniquely identifiy a piece of data.
This was just used for explanation purposes. It does not make sense in a global domain. And identifier needs to be global.

We first thought about using the [CID](https://github.com/ipld/cid) of the node or content itself. This is basically its hashed value of the content of the node (not the node itself), but then we realized that a  [`merkle-path`](https://github.com/ipld/specs/blob/master/IPLD.md#what-is-a-merkle-path) was a better choice.

Both the `CID`s and the `merkle-path`s are unique global identifiers. But the `merkle-path` allows to point to mutable content (if referencing to an [IPNS](http://127.0.0.1:8080/ipns/docs.ipfs.io/guides/concepts/ipns/) link)
Plus a `CID` can be represented as `merkle-path` as well.

This also allows us to not have to dereference the `merkle-path` in order to obtain the `CID`.

### Pointing to anything [todo]
Nodes vs cids...

### The data structure
Considering all the above, a representation of a `node` as an `IPLD` object looks like this
_Check the [terminology](##-terminologiy) section if any doubt_

```json
{
    "origin": {
        "link": {
            "/": "QmUmg7BZC1YP1ca66rRtWKxpXp77WgVHrnv263JtDuvs2k"
        }
    },
    "relations": [
        {
            "target": {
                "link": {
                    "/": "zdpuAvYJaZxBjTV4WH3irwThm5t2a7yTccoN9cWpDmtV4CiNz"
                }
            },
            "type": {
                "link": {
                    "/": "zdpuAvYJaZxBjTV4WH3irwThm5t2a7yTccoN9cWpDmtV4CiNz"
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "target": {
                "link": {
                    "/": "zdpuAyvmoJWTiVrCv1aCHV5xUZ1fxUf4XLkrprKPMMFCNKfj3"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Infinite relation types
One of our frustrations and things we are exploring in detail, is how can we extend how do we relate to information beyond what a user interface or the underlying system allows.

In this case, it translates on allowing the user to definie how a piece of information relates to another. So a `relation` can have a `type`, which is nothing but a `merkle-path` pointing to an expression of the type of relation.

A `type` of a `relation` could be "depends on", "is my dad", "contains"... or anything (text or not). It is the job of the render to understand what this `type` means and how to represent it.

### Render vs structure [outdated]
_This is a work in progress_

If we take a classic mindmap, the connections and nodes may have different shapes, sizes, colors... This is what the render should do. It needs to understand the relations and the nodes so they can be drawn.

It would be easy to add properties such as "color", so the render can pick it up. But unless this is something intrinsic of the node or relation, should be left out of the equation.

This is because the final goal is to be able capture and organize concepts, and not to visualize them in a specific way. We need to keep the data render agnostic. It just happen that we choose a mindmap like render to start exploring how to organize and render this type of data.


### Render format [outdated]
The render should be as dumb as possible and not have to care about how the data is gathered.
So, we should prepare it before handing it out to it.

Right now, and without much exploration, a list of `CIDs` and `node objects` seems a good aproach. This list should already have merged any duplicated node.

Assming this data set:
```json
[
    {
        "/":"<CID1>",
        "relations": [
            {
                "target": "<CID2>"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "/":"<CID1>",
        "relations": [
            {
                "target": "<CID3>"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "/":"<CID2>"
    },
]
```

Should be mapped to:

```json
{
    "<CID1>": {
        "/":"<CID1>",
        relations: [
            {
                "target": "<CID2>"
            },
            {
                "target": "<CID3>"
            }
        ]
    },
    "<CID2>":{
        "/":"<CID2>",
    },
    "<CID3>":{
        "/":"<CID3>",
    }
}
```




## Dimensions and recursivitiy
_Work in progress_

It is a requirement for our mindmap design to be able to represent relations that our mind can naturally concieve such as a bi-directional link ( `A` ⇄ `B` ) or a [`direct graph`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph) like connections ( `A` → `B` → `C` → `A` )

We can express a relations between two `CID`s as coordinate. Where the abscissa is the origin `CID` and the ordinate is the target `CID`. (`originCID`, `targetCID`)

A bi-directional link: (`A`, `B`), (`B`, `B`)  
And the direct graph: (`A`, `B`), (`B`, `C`), (`C`, `A`)

The problem is that the `IPFS` domain as single dimensional space. The points of this spaces are the `CID`s (assuming no collisions), which are just numbers on a line. This is a property we inherit from its [`DAG`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph) structure.

`IPLD` and therefore a `mindmap node` are part of the `IPFS` domain, so they live on this 1D world.
This prevents us from making rescursive/ciclic references like the examples above, since pointing s, breaking the relation in the process.

If we treat the `mindmap node` like it lives in a paral.lel domain we gain an extra degree of freedom.
Now we have two 1D spaces. Both domains are made out `CID`s of a [multi-hash](https://github.com/multiformats/multihash) tuple. The `mindmap domain` only contains the `mindmap node`s set.  And the `content domain` contains all the `IPFS` `CID`s except the `mindmap node` `CID`s.  

The trick here is that the node identifier is not its `CID` but the `originCID` (different dimension) and the two parameters of the relation are from the `content domain` (they can't point to a `mindmap node` because it does not exist in their world).

`nX`(`cA`) → `cB` 
`nY`(`cB`) → `cC`
`nZ`(`cC`) → `cA` 

This implies that a set of nodes can't be referencing to them self as a direct-graph.

A [`node cluster`](###-node-cluster) is the set of nodes that are poining to the same `CID`.
a coordinate in this space, where the abcissa is the content that is pointing at, and the ordenate is 

_I will love to get more thoughts on this, and some help in improving the wording_

### Node cluster
One of the [original specs](##-original-specs) was:
> It needs to work on a global domain. This means that two different mindmaps pointing to the same concept should converge if put together

We call this convergence a `node cluster` (_would love a better name_). In other words is the set of nodes that are poining to the same `CID`.
