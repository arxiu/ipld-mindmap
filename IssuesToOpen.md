# Data structure. Triplet vs Tree.
 `origin`, `target` and relation `type` until now form the atomic piece we need to operate.
 Conceptually they are exactly the same as the `subject`, `object` and `predicate` used in the [RDF specs]().

The previous are called a `semantic triplet`

Insticntively it seems a good aproach that fits on our original specifications, but we are working under two different paradigmns.

### Everything is content addressed
This allows us to make references to the everything, including a `semantic triplet` itself.

### We're not looking for consensus
Our ultimate goal is to provide tools that allow much greater efficiency regarding the usage of information, as a individual/mind. It is not our goal to make search engines to find and understand the content.
