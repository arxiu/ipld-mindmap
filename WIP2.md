###1 — Context

Collection of ideas and thoughts to establish the conceptual framework.

####1.1 — General

1. **Technology** is everywhere and has dramatically changed landscapes and societies [6].

1. Everything is **energy** [3] and energy is **information** in its purest sense [4]. The brain receives information and translates into a picture called reality.

####1.2 — Frustrations 

1. We are at the Age of Information, which is not the same to say that we are living in the Age of Understanding. Information has no meaning by itself. 

1. Brevity in communication is becoming a problem. The quest for being more efficient in an individual level, energy wise, is creating a deficit on the same quest from a collective perspective <span id="back1">[:hourglass:](#footnote1)</span>. But at the same time, “energy and resource efficiency is vital at the level of society and the biosphere” <sup id="back2">[2](#footnote2)</sup>.

1. “intellectual labour will become increasingly more important relative to physical labour […] Where the price of information distribution is going towards zero with ever more efficient tools to distribute information is being invented. […] it is not clear what form markets for information will take with the evolution of the information age.” [5]

1. Anyboy with a device connected to the internet have the possibility to share a subjective point of view of any topic. We don’t have the necessary tools to process all this massive amount of information directly, so we access to it through information retreaval systems that help us filtering the sign from the noise. The corporations acting as intermediaries have an agenda. [7]

1. The data you generate online (from mere traces of your navigation history to content created voluntary) has value. It is collected and generally used to sell you products and services. This creates a marketplace where you are the product. You don’t own your data. [8][9][10]

####1.3 — Pending to develop

— relationship between technology and people  
— relationship between technology and power  
— understanding information as a technology, is then information a soft power?  
— individualist society

<a id="footnote1">:hourglass:</a>: “The very glut of information now available puts a premium on brevity. Brevity leads to abbreviation. Abbreviation leaves out what is unfamiliar. When you have many facts to digest and lots of phone calls to return, the natural desire is to make each information-processing event as concise as possible. Unfortunately, abbreviated information often provides a poor foundation for understanding. The deeper and richer textures of history are precisely the parts that tend to be edited out in the twenty-five- second sound-bites and misconstrued on CNN. It is much easier to convey a message that is a variation on an already understood theme than it is to explore a new paradigm of understanding. You can report a baseball or a cricket score much more easily than you can explain how baseball or cricket is played and what it means.”

<a id="footnote2">2</a>: “A strong analogy exists between over/under consumption of energy at the level of the human body and the industrial metabolism of humanity. […] Similarly [with respect to the activity of energy-sensing cellular pathways in people], in a way that is not just analogical but organically and causally linked, energy and resource efficiency is vital at the level of society and the biosphere. […] We propose the concept that a deep parallel connection exists between over/under consumption of energy at the level of the human body and at the level of the biosphere, and that this connection has profound implications for human and environmental health.”
